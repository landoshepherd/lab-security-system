# lab-security-system

This is a microcontroller project that I've decided to embark on to grow my embedded software skills and just to have fun. It is planned out in three phases:
  1 Motion Sensor
  2 Command and Control (C&C) module
    - Wired speaker
    - Wired alarm light
  3 RFID badge reader module
  
The motion sensor will communicate with the C&C when motion is detected. The C&C will then turn on the alarm light and sound the alarm via the speaker if the options are turned on.

There will also be an RFID card reader that will allow entrance into the lab. Attached to this will be some kind of motor that controls the locking the device.
